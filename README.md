# abstract-classes-and-interfaces

This Java code demonstrates a design pattern using interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance to structure a system for managing operations on data sources. The key components are:

DataSource Interface: Defines a contract for executing operations.
DataSourceOperation Abstract Class: Provides a template for operations such as update, view, and delete while managing a DataSource object.
Concrete Classes (Account, Admin, and User): Extend functionality for specific use cases, with Admin and User inheriting from Account.
The Main class showcases how different components interact, with instances of Account, Admin, and User performing operations on a shared DataSource. This structure highlights the use of abstraction and polymorphism for a clean and extendable design.
